    <p>Getting Started with HTML<p>
      <!--
      What is HTML?
      HTML is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. 
      
      HTML consists of a series of <em>elements</em> that enclose/wrap/<em>mark up</em> content. 

      Anatomy of an HTML Element

      <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
      <opening tag> Content <closing tag>

      All of this makes up an ELEMENT  

      Nesting Elements

      Elements can be placed within other elements, this is called <em>nesting</em>.

      If we wanted to say our cat is VERY grumpy, we could use a <strong> element, which makes it bold.

      <p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
      
      Tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another. 

      Yes:
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      NO:
      <p><strong></p></strong>

      Block VS. Inline Elements

      Block-level elements form a visible block on a page.
      Block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. 
      Ex:
      <h1></h1>
      <p></p>
      <ol></ol>/<ul></ul>/<dl></dl>

      Block elements can nest inside other block elements

      Inline elements are contained WITHIN block-level elements, and surroung only small parts of the document's content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content).
      Inline elements will NOT cause a new line to appear in the document. 
      Ex:
      <a>-creates a hyperlink
      <em></em>
      <strong></strong>
      
      <strong>NOTE</strong> HTML5 redefined the element categories which are much more complicated to understand than <strong>block</em> and <em>inline</em>. So for this intro we'll stick with those terms.

      <strong>NOTE</strong> BLOCK and INLINE should not be confused with the types of CSS boxes that have the same names. 

      Empty Elements

      Not all elements require a closing tag, some use a single tag like the <img> element (embeds an image file onto a page). 

      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png">

      See? No closing tag. 

      <strong>NOTE</strong> Empty elements are sometimes called <em>void elements</em>

      Attributes

      Elements can also have attributes
        the 'class="editor-note"' in the element below:
      <p class="editor-note">My cat is very grumpy</p>

      Attributes contain etra info about the element that won't appear in the content.

      Attributes should have:
        -A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too).
        -The attribute name, followed by an = sign.
        -An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.
      
      Adding Attributes to an Element

      Using <a> (stands for anchor)

      <a href="https://www.mozilla.org" title="The Mozilla homepage" target="_blank">
        
      Boolean Attributes
      
      Attributes written without values. 
      Boolean attributes can only have <em>one</em> value. 

      <input type="text" disabled="disabled">
      
      in shorthand
      <input type="text" disabled>
      (using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input box)

      Omitting quotes around attribute values

      It is possible to write code w/out quotes in some scenarios.
      ex:
      a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>favorite website</a>

      However, as soon as we add the <strong>title</strong> attribute, there are problems
      ex:
      a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage>favorite website</a>

      <strong>ALWAYS INCLUDE ATTRIBUTE QUOTES</strong>

      Single or Double Quotes?

      You may use whichever you prefer, but
      BE CONSISTENT
      No mixing and matching
      However, when you're using one kind you may use the other kind <em>inside</em> the other kind
      ex:
      <a href="https://www.example.com" title="Isn't this fun?">A link to my example.</a>

      Anatomy of an HTML Document

      Whitespace in HTML


      Entity References: Including Special Characters in HTML

      In HTML, the characters < , >, ", ' and & are <strong>special characters</strong>. There are parts of HTML syntax itself. 

      To include these characters we use a <em>character reference</em>. Special codes that represent characters. 

      <   &lt;
      >   &gt;
      "   &quot;
      '   &apos;
      &   &amp;

      HTML Comments

      To write a comment, simply wrap the content in 
      
      <!--   -->

      The Basics: Headings and Paragraphs

      Implementing Structural Hierarchy

      Why Do We Need Structure?

      Why Do We Need Semantics?
      
      Lists

      Unordered:
      <ul>
        <li></li>
        ...
      </ul>

      Ordered:
      <ol>
        <li></li>
        ...
      </ol>

      Nesting Lists

      Perfectly OK to nest on list inside another one

      <ol>
        <li></li>
        ...
        <ul>
          <li></li>
          ...
        </ul>
      </ol>

      Emphasis and Importance
      
      Does much more than just styling the text. 
      
      Elements are an important part of Semantics

      Helps trigger screen readers and is utilized by search engines

      Emphasis:

      <em></em> Puts text into italics

      Could use a <span> element and CSS or the <i> element

      Strong:

      <strong></strong> Makes text bold

      Could use a <span> element and CSS or <b> element
      -->

      <p>Creating Hyperlinks</p>

      <!--

      What is a Hyperlink?

      Anatomy of a Link

      A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an 

      <a> element   and using the 

      href attribute (Hypertext Reference) or <strong>target</strong>

      <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>
      
      Adding Support Information with the Title Attribute

      <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"
         title="The best place to find more information about Mozilla's mission and how to contribute">the Mozilla homepage</a>

      
      Block Level Links

      Even block level elements like <img> can be made into a link
      
      <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">
        <img src="mozilla-image.png" alt="mozilla logo that links to the Mozilla homepage">
      </a>

      URLs and Paths

      URL=Uniform Resource Locator

      URLs use paths to find files. <em>Paths</em> specify where the file you're interested in is located in the filesystem. 

      To link something in the 

      Same Directory:
      <a href="contacts.html"></a>

      Moving down into Subdirectories
      <a href="projects/index.html"></a>

      Moving back up into Parent Directories
      <a href="../pdfs/project-brief.pdf"></a>

      <em>NOTE</em>

      You can combine multiple instances of these features into complex URLs if needed
      ex:
      ../../../complex/path/to/my/file.html

      Document Fragments

      It is possible to link to a specific part of an HTML document (document fragment).
      To do so, you have to assign and id attribute to the element:
      <h2 id="Mailing_address">Mailing address</h2>

      then to link to that specific id, you'd include it at the end of the URL, preceded by the hash/pound # symbol:
      <a href="contacts.html#Mailing_address"></a>

      Can even use document fragment reference on it's own to link to <em>another part of the current document</em>

      <a href="#Mailing_address">...</a>

      Absolute VS. Relative URLs

      absolute URL: points to a location defined by it's absolute location on the web, including protocol and domain name
      ex:
      https://www.example.com/projects/index.html

      An absolute URL will <strong>always</strong> point to the same location, no matter where it's used.

      relative URL: points to a locatino that is <em>relative</em> to the file you are linking from
      ex:
      like above
      project-brief.pdf

      A relative URL will point to different places depending on the actual location of the file you refer from.

      Description Lists

      Third type of list is called a <strong>description lists</strong>.

      <dl>         description list
        <dt></dt>  description term
        <dd></dd>  description definition
        <dt></dt>
        <dd></dd>
      </dl>

      Multiple Descriptions for One Term

      Note that it is permitted to have more than one description for each item

      <dl>
        <dt></dt>
        <dd></dd>
        <dd></dd>
      </dl>

      Quotations

      HTML has features for marking up quotations
      which element depends on whether you are marking up a block or inline quotation

      Blockquotes
      
      If a section of block level content(however little or much) is quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a 
      <blockquote></blockquote>
      element and include the URL pointing to the source of the quote inside a 
      <cite>   attribute.

      ex:
      <p>Here beleow is a blockquote...</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
        <p>The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an an extended quotation.</p>
      </blockquote>

      Default styling will render this as an indented paragraph.

      Inline Quotations

      Inline quotations work exactly the same as block except they use the <q></q> element. 

      <p>The quote element - <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> - is <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.</q></p>

      Citations

      The content of the <em>cite</em> sounds useful, but screenreaders/browsers don't do much with it. You could link the text inside <cite></cite> to the quote source in some way:

      <p>According to the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote"><cite>MDN blockquote page</cite></a>:</p>

      Abbreviations

      <abbr></abbr>

      Used to wrap around an abbreviation or acrynum and provide a full expansion of the term (included inside the <em>title</em> attribute).

      <p>We use <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to structure our web documents.</p>
      <p>I think <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Green did it in the kitchen with the chainsaw.</p>

      Expansion will appear as a tooltip when the term is hovered over. 

      Marking up contact details

      <address></address>
        This wraps around your contact details:

        <address>
          Chris Mills, Manchester, The Grim North, UK
        </address>
      
      Could include more complex markup:
      
      <address>
        <p>
          Chris Mills<br>
          Manchester<br>
          The Grim North<br>
          UK
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Tel: 01234 567 890</li>
          <li>Email: me@grim-north.co.uk</li>
        </ul>
      </address>

      Superscript and Subscript

      <sup></sup> superscript
      <sub></sub> subscript

      Makes exponenets, chemical formulae, etc. 

      Representing Computer Code

      multiple elements for marking up comupter code using HTML:

      <code>For marking u pgeneric pieces of computer code</code>
      <pre>for retaining whitespace (generally code blocks)-if you use indentation or excess whitespace inside text, browsers will ignore it and it will not be rendered. 
        wrapping white space in the <pre></pre>tags preserves it exactly as it is in your text editor.
      </pre>
      <var>For specifically marking up variable names</var>
      <kbd>For marking up keyboard (and other types) input entered</kbd>
      <samp>For marking up output of a computer program</samp>

      Marking Up Times and Dates

      <time>for marking up times and dates in a machine-readable format.</time>

      <time datetime="2016-01-20">20 January 2016</time>

      People write times and dates in varying ways, but writing this way standardizes for computers. 

      Standard simple date
      <time datetime="2016-01-20">20 January 2016</time>
      Just year and month
      <time datetime="2016-01">January 2016</time>
      Just month and day
      <time datetime="01-20">20 January</time>
      Just time, hours and minutes
      <time datetime="19:30">19:30</time>
      Seconds and Milliseconds too
      <time datetime="19:30:01.856">19:30:01.856</time>
      Date and time
      <time datetime="2016-01-20T19:30">7.30pm, 20 January 2016</time>
      date and time with timezone offset
      <time datetime="2016-01-20T19:30+01:00">7.30pm, 20 January 2016 is 8.30pm in France</time>
      Calling out a specific week number
      <time datetime="2016-W04">The fourth week of 2016</time> -->

      <strong>
      Document and Website Structure
      </strong>
      <!--
      HTML boasts a number of block level elements used to define areas of your website:
      <ul>
        <li>"the header"</li>
        <li>"the navigation menu"</li>
        <li>"the main content column"</li>
        <li>"etc"</li>
      </ul>

      How to plan a basic website structure, and write the HTML to represent this structure. 

      Basic Sections of a Document

      Even though they look different, pages all ten to share similar standard components. 

      <dl>
      <dt>header:</dt>
      <dd>usually a big strip across the top w/heading, logo, tagline. Usually stays the same from one page to another.</dd>

      <dt>navigation bar:</dt>
      <dd>Links to the site's main sections; buttons, links, or tabs.</dd>
      <dd>Like the header, usually remains consistent from one page to the next.</dd> 

      <dt>main content:</dt>
      <dd>big area in the center that contains most of the unique content:
        <ul>
          <li>the video you want to watch</li>
          <li>the main story you're reading</li>
          <li>the map you want to view</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>sidebar:</dt>
      <dd> Peripheral information, links, quotes, ads, etc.</dd>
      <dd>Usually contextual to what is contained in the main content.</dd>

      <dt>footer:</dt>
      <dd>strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or cnatct info.</dd>
      <dd>Sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.</dd>
      </dl>

      HTML for structuring content

      With the right CSS you can use pretty much any elements to wrap around different sections and get a website looking how you want, but its important to
      respect semantics
      use the right element for the job

      While font size and color may help sighted people to find content, it won't help people who don't use sight as a main sense

      You can mark up sections of content based on their <em>functionality</em>-
      use elements that represent sections of content. 

      For this purpose, HTML provides dedicated tags:

      header: <header></header>
      navigation bar: <nav></nav>
      main content: <main></main>, with various subsections represented by:
        <article></article>
        <section></section>
        <div></div> elements
      sidebar: <aside></aside>; often placed inside <main>
      footer: <footer></footer>
      
      <main>Is for content <em>unique to this page</em></main>
      -Use ONLY ONCE per page
      -Put it directly inside <body></body>

      <article> encloses a block of related content that makes sense on it's own w/out the rest of the page(e.g. a single blog post).</article>

      <section>Similar to article but
        -more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality
        -a mini map
        -a set of article headlines and summaries
        -a theme
        Considered best practice to begin each section with a <em>heading</em>. </section>
      
      <aside>contains content not directly related to main content but can provide addtion info indirectly related
        -glossary entries
        -author biography
        -related links
        -etc
      </aside>

      <header>Represents a group of introductory content. 
        If it is a child of <body></body> it defines the global header of the webpage,
        but if child of <article></article> or <section></section> it defines a specific header for that section (don't confuse with titles and headings).
      </header>

      <nav>contains main navigation functionality for the page</nav>

      <footer>represent a group of end content for a page</footer>

      Non-Semantic Wrappers
      There are situations where there isn't an ideal semantic element to group some items together or wrap some content. You might want to group a set of elements together to affect them all as a single entity with CSS or JS. In these instances, HTML uses:
      <div></div>
      and
      <span></span>

      These should preferably be used with a suitable CLASS attribute, to provide a label so they can be easily targeted. 

      <span> is an inline non-semantic element
        only use if you can't think of a better semantic text element.</span>
      
      <div> is a block level non-semantic element
        only use if you can't think of a better semantic block element.</div>
      
      WARNING: Divs are so convenient that it's easy to use them too much. 
      ONLY USE THEM WHEN THERE IS NO BETTER SEMANTIC SOLUTION
      and
      REDUCE THEIR USAGE TO THE MINIMUM otherwise you'll have a hard time updating and maintainging your documents. 

      Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules

      <br></br>
      <hr></hr>

      <br>:the line break element.

      creates a line break in a paragraph; the only way to force a rigid structure in a situation where you want a series of fixed short lines: think postal address or poem. 

      <p>There once was a man named O'Dell<br>
        Who loved to write HRML<br>
        But his structure was bad, his semantics were sad<br>
        and his markup didn't read very well.</p>
      
      <hr>: the thematic break element
      
      create a horizontal rule in the document that denotes a thematic change in text (e.g. a change in topic or scene.) 
      Visually it looks like a horizontal line

      Planning a Simple Website

      Once you've planned out structure of a simple page, next logical step is to try and work out:
      -What content you want to put on a whole website
      -what pages you need
      -how they should be arranged
      -how they should link to one another for the best user experience.
      
      -This is called
      INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE.

      In a large, complex website, A LOT of planningn can go into this process, but for a simple site this can be simple and fun

      1. You'll have a few elements common to most (if not all) pages:
      -nav menu
      -footer content

      Write down what you want to have common to every page

      2. Draw a rough sketch of what you want the website to look like

      3. Brainstorm all unique content you want to have. This might be a big list

      4. Sort content items into groups to give an idea of what might live together on different pages. Very similar to <em>Card Sorting</em>

      5. Sketch a rough sitemap

      Debugging <HTML></HTML>

      Debugging doesn't have to scary-the key to being comfortable with writing and debuggin any programming language or code is familiarity with both the language and the tools

      HTML and Debugging

      Permissive Code
      
      What does permissive mean? Generally two kinds of errors
      
      -Syntax errors:
        Spelling or punctuation errors that cause the code to not run. 

      -Logic errors:
        syntax is correct, but the code is not what was intended i.e. program runs incorrectly. 

      Browsers parse HTML permissively, meaning the page still displays even if there are syntax errors.
