    <p>Getting Started with HTML<p>
      <!--
      What is HTML?
      HTML is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. 
      
      HTML consists of a series of <em>elements</em> that enclose/wrap/<em>mark up</em> content. 

      Anatomy of an HTML Element

      <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
      <opening tag> Content <closing tag>

      All of this makes up an ELEMENT  

      Nesting Elements

      Elements can be placed within other elements, this is called <em>nesting</em>.

      If we wanted to say our cat is VERY grumpy, we could use a <strong> element, which makes it bold.

      <p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
      
      Tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another. 

      Yes:
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      NO:
      <p><strong></p></strong>

      Block VS. Inline Elements

      Block-level elements form a visible block on a page.
      Block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. 
      Ex:
      <h1></h1>
      <p></p>
      <ol></ol>/<ul></ul>/<dl></dl>

      Block elements can nest inside other block elements

      Inline elements are contained WITHIN block-level elements, and surroung only small parts of the document's content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content).
      Inline elements will NOT cause a new line to appear in the document. 
      Ex:
      <a>-creates a hyperlink
      <em></em>
      <strong></strong>
      
      <strong>NOTE</strong> HTML5 redefined the element categories which are much more complicated to understand than <strong>block</em> and <em>inline</em>. So for this intro we'll stick with those terms.

      <strong>NOTE</strong> BLOCK and INLINE should not be confused with the types of CSS boxes that have the same names. 

      Empty Elements

      Not all elements require a closing tag, some use a single tag like the <img> element (embeds an image file onto a page). 

      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png">

      See? No closing tag. 

      <strong>NOTE</strong> Empty elements are sometimes called <em>void elements</em>

      Attributes

      Elements can also have attributes
        the 'class="editor-note"' in the element below:
      <p class="editor-note">My cat is very grumpy</p>

      Attributes contain etra info about the element that won't appear in the content.

      Attributes should have:
        -A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too).
        -The attribute name, followed by an = sign.
        -An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.
      
      Adding Attributes to an Element

      Using <a> (stands for anchor)

      <a href="https://www.mozilla.org" title="The Mozilla homepage" target="_blank">
        
      Boolean Attributes
      
      Attributes written without values. 
      Boolean attributes can only have <em>one</em> value. 

      <input type="text" disabled="disabled">
      
      in shorthand
      <input type="text" disabled>
      (using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input box)

      Omitting quotes around attribute values

      It is possible to write code w/out quotes in some scenarios.
      ex:
      a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>favorite website</a>

      However, as soon as we add the <strong>title</strong> attribute, there are problems
      ex:
      a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage>favorite website</a>

      <strong>ALWAYS INCLUDE ATTRIBUTE QUOTES</strong>

      Single or Double Quotes?

      You may use whichever you prefer, but
      BE CONSISTENT
      No mixing and matching
      However, when you're using one kind you may use the other kind <em>inside</em> the other kind
      ex:
      <a href="https://www.example.com" title="Isn't this fun?">A link to my example.</a>

      Anatomy of an HTML Document

      Whitespace in HTML


      Entity References: Including Special Characters in HTML

      In HTML, the characters < , >, ", ' and & are <strong>special characters</strong>. There are parts of HTML syntax itself. 

      To include these characters we use a <em>character reference</em>. Special codes that represent characters. 

      <   &lt;
      >   &gt;
      "   &quot;
      '   &apos;
      &   &amp;

      HTML Comments

      To write a comment, simply wrap the content in 
      
      <!--   -->

      The Basics: Headings and Paragraphs

      Implementing Structural Hierarchy

      Why Do We Need Structure?

      Why Do We Need Semantics?
      
      Lists

      Unordered:
      <ul>
        <li></li>
        ...
      </ul>

      Ordered:
      <ol>
        <li></li>
        ...
      </ol>

      Nesting Lists

      Perfectly OK to nest on list inside another one

      <ol>
        <li></li>
        ...
        <ul>
          <li></li>
          ...
        </ul>
      </ol>

      Emphasis and Importance
      
      Does much more than just styling the text. 
      
      Elements are an important part of Semantics

      Helps trigger screen readers and is utilized by search engines

      Emphasis:

      <em></em> Puts text into italics

      Could use a <span> element and CSS or the <i> element

      Strong:

      <strong></strong> Makes text bold

      Could use a <span> element and CSS or <b> element
      -->

      <p>Creating Hyperlinks</p>

      <!--

      What is a Hyperlink?

      Anatomy of a Link

      A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an 

      <a> element   and using the 

      href attribute (Hypertext Reference) or <strong>target</strong>

      <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>
      
      Adding Support Information with the Title Attribute

      <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"
         title="The best place to find more information about Mozilla's mission and how to contribute">the Mozilla homepage</a>

      
      Block Level Links

      Even block level elements like <img> can be made into a link
      
      <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">
        <img src="mozilla-image.png" alt="mozilla logo that links to the Mozilla homepage">
      </a>

      URLs and Paths

      URL=Uniform Resource Locator

      URLs use paths to find files. <em>Paths</em> specify where the file you're interested in is located in the filesystem. 

      To link something in the 

      Same Directory:
      <a href="contacts.html"></a>

      Moving down into Subdirectories
      <a href="projects/index.html"></a>

      Moving back up into Parent Directories
      <a href="../pdfs/project-brief.pdf"></a>

      <em>NOTE</em>

      You can combine multiple instances of these features into complex URLs if needed
      ex:
      ../../../complex/path/to/my/file.html

      Document Fragments

      It is possible to link to a specific part of an HTML document (document fragment).
      To do so, you have to assign and id attribute to the element:
      <h2 id="Mailing_address">Mailing address</h2>

      then to link to that specific id, you'd include it at the end of the URL, preceded by the hash/pound # symbol:
      <a href="contacts.html#Mailing_address"></a>

      Can even use document fragment reference on it's own to link to <em>another part of the current document</em>

      <a href="#Mailing_address">...</a>

      Absolute VS. Relative URLs

      absolute URL: points to a location defined by it's absolute location on the web, including protocol and domain name
      ex:
      https://www.example.com/projects/index.html

      An absolute URL will <strong>always</strong> point to the same location, no matter where it's used.

      relative URL: points to a locatino that is <em>relative</em> to the file you are linking from
      ex:
      like above
      project-brief.pdf

      A relative URL will point to different places depending on the actual location of the file you refer from.

      Description Lists

      Third type of list is called a <strong>description lists</strong>.

      <dl>         description list
        <dt></dt>  description term
        <dd></dd>  description definition
        <dt></dt>
        <dd></dd>
      </dl>

      Multiple Descriptions for One Term

      Note that it is permitted to have more than one description for each item

      <dl>
        <dt></dt>
        <dd></dd>
        <dd></dd>
      </dl>

      Quotations

      HTML has features for marking up quotations
      which element depends on whether you are marking up a block or inline quotation

      Blockquotes
      
      If a section of block level content(however little or much) is quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a 
      <blockquote></blockquote>
      element and include the URL pointing to the source of the quote inside a 
      <cite>   attribute.

      ex:
      <p>Here beleow is a blockquote...</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
        <p>The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an an extended quotation.</p>
      </blockquote>

      Default styling will render this as an indented paragraph.

      Inline Quotations

      Inline quotations work exactly the same as block except they use the <q></q> element. 

      <p>The quote element - <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> - is <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.</q></p>

      Citations

      The content of the <em>cite</em> sounds useful, but screenreaders/browsers don't do much with it. You could link the text inside <cite></cite> to the quote source in some way:

      <p>According to the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote"><cite>MDN blockquote page</cite></a>:</p>

      Abbreviations

      <abbr></abbr>

      Used to wrap around an abbreviation or acrynum and provide a full expansion of the term (included inside the <em>title</em> attribute).

      <p>We use <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to structure our web documents.</p>
      <p>I think <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Green did it in the kitchen with the chainsaw.</p>

      Expansion will appear as a tooltip when the term is hovered over. 

      Marking up contact details

      <address></address>
        This wraps around your contact details:

        <address>
          Chris Mills, Manchester, The Grim North, UK
        </address>
      
      Could include more complex markup:
      
      <address>
        <p>
          Chris Mills<br>
          Manchester<br>
          The Grim North<br>
          UK
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Tel: 01234 567 890</li>
          <li>Email: me@grim-north.co.uk</li>
        </ul>
      </address>

      Superscript and Subscript

      <sup></sup> superscript
      <sub></sub> subscript

      Makes exponenets, chemical formulae, etc. 

      Representing Computer Code

      multiple elements for marking up comupter code using HTML:

      <code>For marking u pgeneric pieces of computer code</code>
      <pre>for retaining whitespace (generally code blocks)-if you use indentation or excess whitespace inside text, browsers will ignore it and it will not be rendered. 
        wrapping white space in the <pre></pre>tags preserves it exactly as it is in your text editor.
      </pre>
      <var>For specifically marking up variable names</var>
      <kbd>For marking up keyboard (and other types) input entered</kbd>
      <samp>For marking up output of a computer program</samp>

      Marking Up Times and Dates

      <time>for marking up times and dates in a machine-readable format.</time>

      <time datetime="2016-01-20">20 January 2016</time>

      People write times and dates in varying ways, but writing this way standardizes for computers. 

      Standard simple date
      <time datetime="2016-01-20">20 January 2016</time>
      Just year and month
      <time datetime="2016-01">January 2016</time>
      Just month and day
      <time datetime="01-20">20 January</time>
      Just time, hours and minutes
      <time datetime="19:30">19:30</time>
      Seconds and Milliseconds too
      <time datetime="19:30:01.856">19:30:01.856</time>
      Date and time
      <time datetime="2016-01-20T19:30">7.30pm, 20 January 2016</time>
      date and time with timezone offset
      <time datetime="2016-01-20T19:30+01:00">7.30pm, 20 January 2016 is 8.30pm in France</time>
      Calling out a specific week number
      <time datetime="2016-W04">The fourth week of 2016</time> -->

      <strong>
      Document and Website Structure
      </strong>
      <!--
      HTML boasts a number of block level elements used to define areas of your website:
      <ul>
        <li>"the header"</li>
        <li>"the navigation menu"</li>
        <li>"the main content column"</li>
        <li>"etc"</li>
      </ul>

      How to plan a basic website structure, and write the HTML to represent this structure. 

      Basic Sections of a Document

      Even though they look different, pages all ten to share similar standard components. 

      <dl>
      <dt>header:</dt>
      <dd>usually a big strip across the top w/heading, logo, tagline. Usually stays the same from one page to another.</dd>

      <dt>navigation bar:</dt>
      <dd>Links to the site's main sections; buttons, links, or tabs.</dd>
      <dd>Like the header, usually remains consistent from one page to the next.</dd> 

      <dt>main content:</dt>
      <dd>big area in the center that contains most of the unique content:
        <ul>
          <li>the video you want to watch</li>
          <li>the main story you're reading</li>
          <li>the map you want to view</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>sidebar:</dt>
      <dd> Peripheral information, links, quotes, ads, etc.</dd>
      <dd>Usually contextual to what is contained in the main content.</dd>

      <dt>footer:</dt>
      <dd>strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or cnatct info.</dd>
      <dd>Sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.</dd>
      </dl>

      HTML for structuring content

      With the right CSS you can use pretty much any elements to wrap around different sections and get a website looking how you want, but its important to
      respect semantics
      use the right element for the job

      While font size and color may help sighted people to find content, it won't help people who don't use sight as a main sense

      You can mark up sections of content based on their <em>functionality</em>-
      use elements that represent sections of content. 

      For this purpose, HTML provides dedicated tags:

      header: <header></header>
      navigation bar: <nav></nav>
      main content: <main></main>, with various subsections represented by:
        <article></article>
        <section></section>
        <div></div> elements
      sidebar: <aside></aside>; often placed inside <main>
      footer: <footer></footer>
      
      <main>Is for content <em>unique to this page</em></main>
      -Use ONLY ONCE per page
      -Put it directly inside <body></body>

      <article> encloses a block of related content that makes sense on it's own w/out the rest of the page(e.g. a single blog post).</article>

      <section>Similar to article but
        -more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality
        -a mini map
        -a set of article headlines and summaries
        -a theme
        Considered best practice to begin each section with a <em>heading</em>. </section>
      
      <aside>contains content not directly related to main content but can provide addtion info indirectly related
        -glossary entries
        -author biography
        -related links
        -etc
      </aside>

      <header>Represents a group of introductory content. 
        If it is a child of <body></body> it defines the global header of the webpage,
        but if child of <article></article> or <section></section> it defines a specific header for that section (don't confuse with titles and headings).
      </header>

      <nav>contains main navigation functionality for the page</nav>

      <footer>represent a group of end content for a page</footer>

      Non-Semantic Wrappers
      There are situations where there isn't an ideal semantic element to group some items together or wrap some content. You might want to group a set of elements together to affect them all as a single entity with CSS or JS. In these instances, HTML uses:
      <div></div>
      and
      <span></span>

      These should preferably be used with a suitable CLASS attribute, to provide a label so they can be easily targeted. 

      <span> is an inline non-semantic element
        only use if you can't think of a better semantic text element.</span>
      
      <div> is a block level non-semantic element
        only use if you can't think of a better semantic block element.</div>
      
      WARNING: Divs are so convenient that it's easy to use them too much. 
      ONLY USE THEM WHEN THERE IS NO BETTER SEMANTIC SOLUTION
      and
      REDUCE THEIR USAGE TO THE MINIMUM otherwise you'll have a hard time updating and maintainging your documents. 

      Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules

      <br></br>
      <hr></hr>

      <br>:the line break element.

      creates a line break in a paragraph; the only way to force a rigid structure in a situation where you want a series of fixed short lines: think postal address or poem. 

      <p>There once was a man named O'Dell<br>
        Who loved to write HRML<br>
        But his structure was bad, his semantics were sad<br>
        and his markup didn't read very well.</p>
      
      <hr>: the thematic break element
      
      create a horizontal rule in the document that denotes a thematic change in text (e.g. a change in topic or scene.) 
      Visually it looks like a horizontal line

      Planning a Simple Website

      Once you've planned out structure of a simple page, next logical step is to try and work out:
      -What content you want to put on a whole website
      -what pages you need
      -how they should be arranged
      -how they should link to one another for the best user experience.
      
      -This is called
      INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE.

      In a large, complex website, A LOT of planningn can go into this process, but for a simple site this can be simple and fun

      1. You'll have a few elements common to most (if not all) pages:
      -nav menu
      -footer content

      Write down what you want to have common to every page

      2. Draw a rough sketch of what you want the website to look like

      3. Brainstorm all unique content you want to have. This might be a big list

      4. Sort content items into groups to give an idea of what might live together on different pages. Very similar to <em>Card Sorting</em>

      5. Sketch a rough sitemap

      <!--
      Debugging doesn't have to scary-the key to being comfortable with writing and debuggin any programming language or code is familiarity with both the language and the tools

      HTML and Debugging

      Permissive Code
      
      What does permissive mean? Generally two kinds of errors
      
      -Syntax errors:
        Spelling or punctuation errors that cause the code to not run. 

      -Logic errors:
        syntax is correct, but the code is not what was intended i.e. program runs incorrectly. 

      Browsers parse HTML permissively, meaning the page still displays even if there are syntax errors.

In the beginning, the Web was just text, and it was quite boring. but soon we were able to embed images (and other types of content too). 

How Do We Put an Image on a Webpage

use the 

<img> element

this is a void element (cannot have any child content and CANNOT have an end tag)

requires TWO attributes to be useful:

src and alt

src attribute contains a URL pointing to the image you want to embed in the page. just like href, the attr can point to a relative url or an absolute url. 
w/out a src attr an img element has no image to load

if your image is in the same directory as your HTML page, can embed like so:

<img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />

if image is in a subdirectory:

<img src="images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />

and so on

could use the absolute URL

<img src="https://www.example.com/images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />

but this is pointless as it just makes the browser do more work. 

You'll almost always have the images for an HTML page in (or very close to) the same folder. 

WARNING: Most images are copyrighted. Do NOT display an image on your webpage unless:

-you own the image(s).
-you have received explicit, written permission from the image owner.
-you have ample proof that the image is, in fact, in the public domain. 

Copyright violations are illegal and unethical. NEVER point your src attr at an image hosted on someone else's website that you don't have permission to link to. This is called "hotlinking". Again, stealing someone's bandwidth is illegal. It also slows down your page, leaving you with no control over whether the image is removed or replaced with something embarassing.

NOTE: elements like <img> and <video> are sometimes referred to as <em>replaced elements</em>. This is b/c the element's content and size are defined by an external resource (like an image or video file), not by the contents of the element itself. 

Alternative Text

alt attribute
it's value is supposed to be a textual description of the image, for use in situations where the image cannot be seen/displayed or takes a long time to render because of a slow internet connection. 

for example:

<img src="images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeletong; it has a large head with long sharp teeth" />

easiest way to test alt text is to misspell filename so you can see what would display instead. 

useful for the following reasons:

-the user is visually impaired and is using a screen reader to read the web out to them. Quite useful to everyone actually
-spelling of file or path name might be wrong.
-browser doesn't support the image type. some people still use text-only browsers-which, you guessed it, displays the alt text of images.
-provide text for search engines to utilize; e.g. search engines can match alt text with search queries.
-users have turned off images to reduce data transfer volume and distractions. especially common on mobile phones, and in countries where bandwidth is limited or expensive.

What should you write exactly?

it depends on why the image is there at all. in other words,
what you lose if your image doesn't show up.

essentially the key is to deliver a usable experience, even when the images can't be seen. ensures all users are not missing any of the content. 

Width and Height

can use width and height attr to specify each property

can find image's width and height in a number of ways.
then use those sizes specifically

<img src="images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
width="400"
height="341" />

if image displays, wont' change much. but if image does NOT display right away, the browser will leave space for it. 

setting size helps the browser load the page quiker and more smoothly

however, don't alter size of images using HTML attributes. 
Can cause issues with aspect ratio or resolution

Image Titles

as with links, you can add title attributes to images, to provide further supporting info if needed. 

<img src="images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
width="400"
height="341"
title="A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum" />

adding a title gives us a tooltip on mouse hover, just like link titles. 

however, this is NOT recommended. Title has a number of accessibility problems, mainly based around the fact that screen reader support is very unpredictable and most browsers won't show it unless you hover with a mouse (so no access to keyboard users). 

it's better to include such supporting info in the main article text, rather than attached to the image

Annotating Images with Figures and Figure Captions

there are a number of ways to add a caption with an image.

could include a <p> directly below

Problem with above is that there is nothing that semantically links the image to the caption. 

A better solution, use the HTML <figure> and <figcaption> elements. These are created exactly for this purpose: to provide a semantic container for figures and to clearly link the figure to the caption. 

<figure>
  <img src="images/dinosaur.jpg"alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
  width="400"
  height="341" />

  <figcaption>
    A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figcaption> element tells browsers (and assistive tech) that the caption describes the other content of the <figure> element.

A figure doesn't have to be an image. It is an independent unit of content that:

-expresses your meaning in a compact, easy-to-grasp way.
-could go in several places in the page's linear flow.
-provides essential info supporting the main text.

A figure could be several images, a code snippet, audio, video, equations, a table, or something else. 

CSS Background Images

Can also use CSS to embed images into webpages (and JS, but that's another story entirely)

p {
  background-image: url("images/dinosaur.jpg");
}

arguably easier to position and control than HTML images. 

So why bother with HTML?

CSS background-images are for decoration only, something pretty to enhance the visuals. 

These background images have NO semantic meaning whatsoever. They can't have any text equivalents and are invisible to screen readers. 

If and image has MEANING, in terms of content, you should use an HTML image.
If it is purely DECORATION, use a CSS background-image
-->

Video and Audio Content
<!--

Video and Audio on the Web

first influx of online videos and audio were made poissble by proprietary plug-in based technologies like Flash and Silverlight. These had security and accessibility issues and are now obsolete in favor of native HTML solutions
<video>
and
<audio> elements
and the availability of JS APIs for controlling them. 

NOTE: there are plenty of OVPs (online video providers) like YouTube, Dailymotion, and Vimeo, and online audio providers like Soundcloud. These companies offer easy way to host and consume this media, so you don't have to worry about enormous bandwidth consumption. 

The <video> Element

<video src="rabbit320.webm" controls>
  <p>
    your browser don't support HTML video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.webm">link to the video</a> instead.
  </p>
</video>

features of note:

src
  same as for the <img> element, the src (source) attr contains a path to the video 

controls
  users must be able to control video and audio playback (it's especially critical for people who have epilepsy). You must use either the controls attr to include the browser's own control interace, or build you own interface using the appropriate JS API. At a min the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume. 

The paragraph inside the <video> tags
  This is called <em>fallback content</em>-this will be displayd if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the <video> element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers. Can you be anything you like; in this case, we've provided a direct link to the video file, so the user can at least access it some way regardless of waht browser they are using.

Using Multiple Source Formats to Improve Compatibility

problem w/above example. It is possible that the video might not play for you, b/c different browsers support diff video (and audio) formats. There are things to prevent this issue

Contents of a Media File

container formats
  MP3, MP4, WebM are called container formats. Define structure in which the audio and/or video tracks that make up the media are stored, along iwth metadata describing the media, what codecs are used to encode its channels, and so forth

Let's break down a WebM file
contains a 
Movie-
has a main video track and an alternate angle track
plus audio for English and Spanish,
in addition to audo for an English commentary track. 
also include, text tracks for closed captions

audio and video tracks within the container hold data in appropriate format for the codec used to encode that media. 
different formats for audio and video tracks
audio tracks encoded using an audio codec
video tracks encoded using a video codec

different browsers support different video and audio formats, and different container formats (like MP3, MP4, and WebM, which in turn can contain different types of video and audio).
e.g.:

-A WebM container typically packages Vorbis or Opus audio with VB9/VP9 video. Supported in all modern browsers, though older versions may not work. 
-An MP4 container often packages AAC or MP3 audio with H.624 video. 
-Ogg container tends to use Vorbis audio and Theora video. Best support in FF and Chrome, but basically superseded by the better quality WebM format.

some special cases:
e.g.
FLAC codec-simplified container, most commonly stored in FLAC files, which are just raw FLAC tracks

another example is MP3:
actually and MPEG-1 Audio Layer III (MP3) audio track stored within an MPEG or MPEG-2 container. 

an audio player will tend to play an audio track directly, e.g. an MP3 or Ogg file. These don't need containers

Codecs described above exist to compress video and audio into manageable files, since raw audio and video are both exceedingly large. 
each browser supports an assortment of codecs, like Vorbis or H.624, which are used to convert the compressed audio and video into binary data and back. 
each codec has advantages and disadvantages
and each container has positive and negative aspects

things are even more complicated b/c while each browser supports different sets of container file formats, they also each support a different selection of codecs. 
In order to maximize the likelihood that your site or app will work on user's browser, you may need to provide each media file you use in multiple formats. If your site and the user's browser don't share a media format in common, your media WON'T play. 

Choosing the best combo of codecs and containers can be a complicated task. Look to the web for help. 

one more thing: mobile browsers may support additional formats not supported by their desktop equivalents, just like they may not support all the same formats the desktop does. 

So how do we do this?

<video controls>
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support this video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
  </p>
</video>

here we've taken the src attr out of the actual <video> tag and instead included separate <source> elements that point to their own sources. In this case the browser will go through the <source> elements and play the first one that it has the codec to support. Including WebM and MP4 sources should be enough to play your video on most platforms and browsers these days. 

Each <source> element also has a type attr. this IS optional, but is advised to include it. 

type attr contains the MIME type of the file specified by the <source>, and browsers can use the type to immediately skip videos they don't understand. if type ISN'T included, browsers will load and try to play each file until they find one that works, which obv takes time and unnecessary resources

Other <video> Features

number of other features you can include when displaying an HTML video:

<video
  controls
  width="400"
  height="400"
  autoplay
  loop
  muted
  preload="auto"
  poster="poster.png">
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="rabbi320.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support this video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
  </p>
</video>

width and height
  can control size with these or with CSS. in both cases  video will respect it's aspect ratio and fill space with letterbox as necessary

autoplay
  will autoplay media while rest of page loads. 
  DO NOT advise. It is ANNOYING to users

loop
  causes to media to play on a loop. Also ANNOYING, so only if really necessary

muted
  media has sound turned off by default

poster
  URL of an image which will be displayed before video is played. intended to be used for a splash screen or advertising screen

preload
  used for buffering large files; can take one of three values:
  -"none" does not buffer the file
  -"auto" buffers the media file
  -"metadata" buffers only the metadata for the file

The <audio> Element

<audio> works just like <video> with a few small differences:

<audio controls>
  <source src="viper.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
  <source src="viper.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support this audio file. Here is a <a href="viper.mp3">link to the audio</a> instead.
  </p>
</audio>

takes up less space than video player, as there is no visual component, you just need to display controls to play it. other differences from HTML video are as follows:

-<audio> element does NOT support width/height attr-no visual component so there is nothing to assign a width or height to.
-does NOT support poster attr-again, no visual component

Other than this, <audio> supports all the same features as <video>

Displaying Video Text Tracks

Many people can't or don't want to hear the audio/video content they find on the Web, at least at certain times. For example:

-many people have auditory impairments (hard of hearing or deaf)
-may not be able to hear b/c they are in noisy environments (crowded public space, etc)
-in environments where having audio playing would be a distraction or disruption (in a library or when a partner is trying to sleep), having captions can be very useful
-people who don't speak the language of the video might want a text transcript or even translation to help them understand

thanks to HTML video, you can provide a transcript of words being spoken in the audio/video

to do so we use the WebVTT file format and the <track> element

WebVTT is a format text files containing multiple strings of text along with metadata such as the time in the video at which each text string should be displayed, and even limited styling/positioning info. 
These text strings are called CUES and there are several kinds of cues used for different purposes. most common are:

-subtitles
  translations fo foreing material, for people who don't understand the words spoken in the audio.

-captions
  synchronized transcriptions of dialog or descriptions of significant sounds, to let people who can't hear the audio understand what is going on

-timed descriptions
  text which should be spoken by the media player in order to describe important visuals to blind or otherwise visually impaired users
  
typical WebVTT file will look something like:
-->
WEBVTT

1
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.606
This is the first subtitle.

2
00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.074
This is the second.

…
<!--
To get this displayed along with the HTML media playback you need to:

1. save it as a .vtt file in a sensible place
2. link to the .vtt file with <track> element. <track> should be placed within <audio> or <video>, but after all <source> elements. 
use the kind attr to specify whether the cues are 
subtitles
captions
descriptions

Further, use srclang to tell the browser what language you have written the subtitles in. 
Finally, add label to help readers indentify the language they are searching for

Here's an example:

<video controls>
  <source src="example.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="example.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <track kind="subtitles" src="subtitles_es.vtt" srclang="es" label="Spanish" />
</video>
-->

From Object to iframe - Other Embedding technologies
<!--
let's lok at other elements that allow us to embed a wide variety of content types

<iframe> - for embedding other web pages
<embed> - embed external resources like PDF files, etc.
<object> - embed external resources like PDF files, etc.

A Short History of Embedding

First, we had FRAMES- small parts of a website stored in individual HTML pages. These were embedded in a master document called a FRAMESET, which allowed you to specify the area on the screen that each frame filled, rather like sizing the columns and rows of a table.
considered the height of coolness in the mid to late 90's, and there was evidence that having a webpage split up into smaller chunks helped with download speed. 
had many problems however, and as network speeds got faster, the negatives outweighed the positives

then (late 90's, early 2000's), we had PLUGIN technologies like Java Applets and Flash-allowed web devs to embed rich content into webpages such as videos and animations, not available in HTML alone. Embedding these was achieved through elements like
<object> and the lesser used <embed>
have since fallen out of a fashion due to many problems, including accessibility, security, file size, and more. Most major browsers have now stopped supporting plugins such as Flash.

Finally, the <iframe> element appeared (along with other means of embedding content, such as <canvas>, <video>, etc.). This provides a way to embed an entire web document inside another one, as if it were an <img> or other such element. 

iframes in Detail

<iframe> elements are designed to allow you to embed other web docs into the current doc. Great for incorporating third-party content into your website that you might not have direct control over and don't want to have to implement your own version of and don't want to implement your own version of:
-video from online video providers
-commenting systems like Disqus
-maps from online map providers
-advertising banners, etc

There are some security concerns to be aware of, but it doesn't mean you can't use them. 

Let's explore in more detail:

<head>
  <style>
    iframe {
      border: none;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <iframe src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary"
  width="100%"
  height="500"
  allowfullscreen
  sandbox>
  <p>
    <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary">
      Fallback link for browsers that don't support iframes
    </a>
  </p>
</iframe>
</body>

example includes the basic essentials needed to use an <iframe>:

border: none
if used, the <iframe> is displayed without a surrounding border. otherwise, by default, browsers display the <iframe> with a surrounding border (which is generally undesirable).

allowfullscreen
if set, the <iframe> is able to be placed in fullscreen mode using the Fullscreen API (somewhat beyond the scope of this lesson).

src
as with <video>/<img>, contains a path pointing to the URL of the doc to be embedded.

width and height
...duh

Fallback content
similar to other elements like <video>, you can include fallback content to appear b/w the opening and closing <iframe></iframe> tags that will appear if the browser doesn't support the <iframe>. In this case, we have included a link to the page instead. it is unlikely that you'll come across any browser that doesn't support <iframe>s these days

sandbox
this attr, which works in slightly more modern browsers than the rest of the <iframe> features requests heightened security settings: see below.

NOTE: in order to improve speed, it's a good idea to set the iframe's src attr with JS after the main content is done with loading. Makes page usable sooner and decreases your official page load time.

Security Concerns

iframes are a common target (offical term: attack vector) for bad people on the Web (hackers, more accurately, crackers) to attack if they are trying to maliciously modify your webpage, or trick people into doing something they don't want to do, such as reveal sensitive info like u/n and p/w (phishing). 
Because of this there are some security mechanisms and best practices to consider:

Only Embed When Necessary

only embded third-party content when completely necessary. good rule for web security is
"You can never be too cautious. If you made it, double-check it anyway. If someone else made it, assume it's dangerous until proven otherwise".

Besides security, you should also be aware of intellectual property issues. Most content is copyrighted, offline and online, even content you might not expect (for example, most images on Wikimedia Commons). 
DO NOT display something unless you own it or have explicit written permission. 

You can never be too cautious

If content is licensed, you MUST obey the license terms. 

Use HTTPS

HTTPS is the encrypted version of HTTP. You should serve your websites using HTTPS whenever possible

1. HTTPS reduces the chance that remote content has been tampered with in transit,
2. HTTPS prevents embedded content from accessing content in your parent doc and vice versa.

HTTPS-enabling your site requires a special security cert to be installed. 

many hosting providers offer HTTPS-enabled hosting as a default. 

If you DO need to set it up, https://letsencrypt.org
provides tools and instructions

NOTE: Github pages allow content to be served via HTTPS by default, so it's useful for hosting content. 

Always Use the Sandbox Attr

a container for code where it can be used appropriately - or for testing - but can't cause any harm to the rest of the codebase (either accidental or malicious) is called a sandbox. 

give embedded content only the permissions needed for doing its job. 

unsandboxed content can do way too much (executing JS, submitting forms, popup windows, etc). By default, you should impose all available restrictions by using the sandbox attr with no parameters. 

if absolutely required, you can add permissions back one by one (inside the sandbox="" attr value)-see the sandbox reference entry for all the available options. 

NEVER add both allow-scripts and allow-same-origin to your sandbox attr. The embedded content could bypass the Same-origin policy that stops sites from executing scripts, and use JS to turn off sandboxing altogether.

Configure CSP Directives

CSP = content security policy and provides a set of HTTP Headers (metadata sent alogn with your web pages when they are served from a web server) designed to improve the security of your HTML document. 

in regard to <iframe>, you can configure your server to send an appropriate X-Frame-Options header. This can prevent other websites from embedding your content in their web pages (which would enable clickjacking). 

The <embed> and <object> Elements

<embed> and <object> elements serve a different function to <iframe> - these elements are general purpose embedding tools for embedding external content, such as PDFs.

You are unlikely to use these elements very much. 

If you need to display PDFs, it's usually better to link to them, rather than embedding them in the page. 

if you need to use these, you'll need this info at minimum:

<embed
  src
  type
  height
  width
  etc>

<object
  data
  type
  height
  width
  single-tag <param> elements contained within <object>
  >

let's look at an object example that embeds a PDF into a page 

<object data="mypdf.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="800" height="1200">
  <p>
    You don't have a PDF plugin, but you can <a href="mypdf.pdf">download the PDF file.</a>
  </p>
</object>

PDFs were a necessary stepping stone between paper and digital, but they pose many accessibility challenges and can be hard to read on small screens. 
Better to link them

Adding Vector Graphics to the Web
<!--
vector graphics are very useful-have small file sizes and are highly scalable (the don't pixelate when zoomed in or blown up to a large size). 

What are Vector Graphics?

on the web you'll work with two types of images:

-Raster Images-defined used a grid of pixels--a raster image file contains info showing exactly where each pixel is to be placed and exactly what color it should be. 
Popular web raster formats include
-bitmap(.bmp)
-PNG(.png)
-JPEG(.jpg)
-GIF(.gif)

Vector Images-defined using algorithms--vector image file contains shape and path definitions that comp uses to work out what the image should look like when rendered on teh screen. 
-SVG format

Vector image files are much lighter than their raster equivalents, because they only need to hold a handful of algorithms, rather than information on every pixel in the image individually

What is SVG?

SVG is an XML-based laguage for describing vector images--basically markup, like HTML, except that you've got many different elements for defining the shapes you want to appear in your image, and the effects you want to apply to those shapes. 
SVG is for marking up graphics, not content. 
on the simple side, you've got elements for creating simple shapes like <circle> <rect>. More advanced SVG features include <feColorMatrix> (transform colors using a transformation matrix), <animate> (animate parts of your vector graphic) and <mask> (apply a mask over the top of your image). 

the following code creates a circle and a rectangle:

<svg
  version="1.1"
  baseProfile="full"
  width="300"
  height="200"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="black" />
  <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="90" fill="blue" />
</svg>

yes you can handcode simple SVG in a text editor, but it gets complicated fast. 
Most people use a vector graphics editor like Inkscape or Illustrator

SVG has further advantages:

-text in vector images remains accessible (which also benefits your SEO).
-SVGs lend themselves well to styling/scripting, b/c each component of the image is an element that can be styled via CSS or scripted via JS.

disadvantages:
-SVG gets complicated very quickly, file sizes can grow; complex SVGs can take significant processing time in the browser
-SVG van be harder to create than raster images, depending on the image you're trying to create
-SVG is not supported in older browsers

Raster graphics are arguably better for complex precision images such as photos, for reasons above

Adding SVG to your Pages

The Quick Way: <img> Element

to embed via <img> element, just reference with src attr as you'd expect. You WILL need a height or a width attr (or both if your SVG has no inherent aspect ratio). 

<img
  src="equilateral.svg"
  alt="triangle with all three sides equal"
  height="87"
  width="100" />

Pros

-quick, familiar image syntax w/built-in text equivalent (alt attr)
-make the image into a hyperlink easily by nesting <img> inside an <a>
-SVG file can be cached by the browser=faster loading times for any page that uses the image loaded in the future

Cons

-cannot manipulate with JS
-if you want to use CSS, you must include INLINE CSS styles in your SVG code (external stylesheets invoked take no effect).
-Cannot restyle image with CSS pseudoclasses (like :focus).

Troubleshooting and Cross-Browser Support

for browsers that don't support SVG (IE 8 and below, Android 2.3 and below), you could reference a PNG or JPG from your src attr and use a srcset attr to reference the SVG. older browsers will load the PNG in place of the SVG

<img 
  src="equilateral.png"
  alt="triangle with equal sides"
  srcset="equilateral.svg" />

*
srcset-one or more strings separated by commas, indicating possible image sources for the user agent to use. Each string is composed of:

1. A URL to an image

2. Optionally, whitespace followed by one of:
  -a width descriptor (positive integer directly followed by w). width descriptor is divided by the source size given in the sizes attr to calculate the effective pixel density. 
  -a pixel density descriptor (a positive floating point number directly followed by x).

the user agent selects any of the available sources at its discretion. Provides them with significant leeway to tailer their selection based on things like user preferences or bandwidth conditions. 
*

Can also use SVGs as CSS background images. in the following code, older browsers will stick with the png that they understand, while newer browsers will load the SVG:

background: url("fallback.png") no-repeat center;
background-image: url("image.svg");
background-size: contain;

like the <img> method described above, inserting SVGs using CSS background images means the SVG can't be manipulated with JS, and is also subject to same CSS limitations

How to Include SVG Code Inside Your HTML

SVG Inline or inlining SVG-open up the SVG file in a text editor, copy the SVG code, and paste it into your HTML document.
Make sure your SVG code snippet begins with an <svg> start tag and ends with an </svg> end tag. Here's an example:

<svg width="200" height="200">
  <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="green" />
</svg>

Pros
-SVG inline saves an HTTP request, and can reduce loading time
-can assign classes and ids to SVG elements and style them with CSS, either within SVG or whever you put the CSS style rules for your HTML document. In fact, you can use any SVG presentation attr as a CSS property
-Inling SVG is the only approach that lets you use CSS interactions (like :focus) and CSS animations on your SVG image (even in your regular stylesheet).
-can make SVG markup into a hyperlink by wrapping in <a> element

Cons
-method is only suitable if using the SVG in only one place. Duplication makes for resource-intensive maintenance
-Extra SVG code increases the size of your HTML file
-browser cannot cache inline SVG as it would cache regular image assets, so pages that include image will not load faster after the first page containing the image is loaded
-may include fallback in a <foreignObject> element, but browsers that support SVG still download any fallback images. need to weight whether the extra overhead is really worthwhile, just to support obsolescent browsers.

How to Embed an SVG With an Iframe

SVG images can be opened in the browser just like webpages. So embedding an SVG doc with <iframe> is done just like in "From <object> to <iframe>-other embedding technologies"

quick review:

<iframe src="triangle.svg" width="500" height="500" sandbox>
  <img src="triangle.png" alt="Triangle with three unequal sides" />
</iframe>

definitely not the best method to choose

Cons
-iframes do have a fallback mechanism, but browsers only display the fallback if they lack support for iframes altogether
-unless the SVg and your current webpage have the same origin, you cannot us JS on your main webpage to manipulate the SVG

Responsive Images
<!--
responsive images-images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features.
Helps to improve performance across different devices
Responsive images are just one part of responsive design, an important CSS topic. 

Why Responsive Images?

a typical scenario: a typical website may contain a header image and some content images below the header. The header image will likely span the whole width of the header, and the content image will fit somewhere inside the content column

Works well on a wide screen device, like a laptop or desktop

however, issues arise when viewed on a narrow screen.

Header looks ok, but starting to take up a lot of the screen height for mobile devices and it's difficult to see any detail in the subjects of the content image

an improvement would be to display a cropped version of the image which displays the important details when the site is viewed on a narrow screen. 

the general problem whereby you want to serve different cropped images in that way, for various layouts, is commonly known as the Art Direction Problem

In addition, no need to embed large images on page if it is being viewed on a mobile sreen.
conversely, a small raster image starts to look grainy when displayed larger than its original size. called Resolution Switching Problem. 

Conversely (again lol), unnecesary to display a large image on a screen significantly smaller than the size it was meant for. Doing so can waste bandwidth; in particular, mobile users don't want to waste bandwidth by downloading a large image intended for desktop users, when a small image would do for their device. ideally, multiple resolutions would e made available to user's browser. 

to make it more complicated, some devices have high resolution screens that need larger images thhan you might expect. basically the same problem. 

Vector graphics are ideal-small in file size and scale well
BUT they aren't useful for everything. 
good for:
simple graphics, patters, interface elements, etc. but not good for 
heavy detail like photos

Responsive Image Technologies were implemented recently to solve the problems of different screen sizes (didn't exist in the beginning!)
allow you to:
offer the browser several image files, either all showing the same thing but containing different numbers of pixels-Resolution Switching
or different images suitable for different space allocation-Art Direction

How Do You Create Responsive Images?

Resolution Switching: Different Sizes

we want to display identical image content, just larger or smaller depending on the device
standard <img> element traditionally lets you point the browser to a single source file:

<img src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg" alt="Elva dresses as a fair" />

We can however use two attr-srcset and sizes-to provide several additional source images along with hints to help the browser pick the right one. 

<img
  srcset="elva-fair-480w.jpg 480w, elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
        800px"
  src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
  alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />

srcset and sizes attr are easier to understand if you format them with a different part of the attr on each line
  each value contains a comma-separated list, and each part of those lists is made up of three sub-parts.

srcset-defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is. each set of image info is separated from the previous one by a comma. For each one, we write:

1. an image filename (elva-fairy-480w.jpg)
2. a spae
3. The image's intrinsic width in pixels (480w)-note this uses w unit, not px as you might expect. An image's intrinsic size is it's real size.

sizes-defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true. In this case, before each comma we write:

1. a media condition ((max-width:600px))-describes a possible state the screen can be in. Here we are saying "when the viewport width is 600px or less".
2. a space
3. the width of the slot the image will fill when the media condition is true (480px)
(for slot width-can provide a relative width (for example, 50vw), but NOT a percentage.)

with these attr in place, browser will:

1. look at its device width
2. work out which media condition in the sizes list is the first one to be true
3. look at slot size given to the media query
4. load the image referenced in the srcset list that has the same size as the slot or, if there isn't one, the first image that is bigger than the chosen slot size.

Voila! a supporting browser with a viewport width of 480px loads the page, the (max-width: 600px) media condition will be true, and so the browser chooses the 480px slot. 

NOTE: when testing with desktop browser, if the browser fails to load the narrower images when you have the window set to it's narrowest width, have a look at what the viewport is (you can approximate it by going into the browser's JS console and typing in
document.querySelector('html').clientWidth).
Different browsers have min sizes that they'll let you reduce the window width to, and they might be wider than you think. 

NOTE: in the <head> of the example above, you'd see the line
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
forces mobile browsers to adopt their real viewport width for loading web pages (some mobile browsers lie about their vw width, and instead load pages at a larger vw then shrink the loaded page down, not very helpful for responsive images or design).

Resolution Switching: Same Size, Different Resolutions

if supporting multiple display resolutions, but everyone sees your image at the same real-world size on the screen, you can allow the browser to choose an appropriate resolution image by using srcset with x-descriptors and without sizes-an easier syntax! 

<img
  srcset="elva-fair-320w.jpg, elva-fairy-480w.jpg 1.5x, elva-fairy-640w.jpg 2x"
  src="elva-fairy-640w.jpg"
  alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />

in above example following CSS is applied to image

img {
  width: 320px;
}

Here, sizes is not needed-browser works out what resolution the display is that it is being shown on, and serves the most appropriate image referenced in the srcset. 
if the device has a standard/low res display, with one device pixel representing 1 CSS pixel, the elva-fairy-320w.jpg will be loaded (the 1x is implied so you don't have to specify it). 
if device has high res of two device px per CSS px or more, the elva-fairy-640w.jpg image will be loaded

Art Direction

recap: art direction problem involves wanting to change the image displayed to suit different image display sizes.

example: on a large display, shows a landscape shot with a person in the middle. BUT, on a mobile display image is shrunk down and hard to see.
Would be better to show a smaller, portrait image on mobile

<picture> element allows us to implement this solution.

<img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva" />
(https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/not-responsive.html)

can fix with <picture>!
like <video> and <audio>, the <picture> element is a wrapper containing several <source> elements that provide different sources for the browser to choose from, followed by the all-important <img> element. 

a responsive version looks like this:

<picture>
  <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="elva-480w-close-portrait.jpg" />
  <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="elva-800w.jpg" />
  <img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva" />
</picture>

-<source> elements include a media attr that contains a media condition-as w/1st srcset ex. these conditions are tests that decide which image is shown-the FIRST one that returns true will be displayed.
-srcset attrs contain the path to the image to display. 
-in all cases, you must provide an <img> element, with src and alt, right before </picture>, otherwise no images will appear. provides a default case that will apply when none of the media conditions return true 

NOTE: should use media attr only in art direction scenarios, when you do use media, don't also offer media conditions within the sizes attr.

Why Can't We Just Do This Using CSS or JS?

when browser starts to load a page, it starts to download (preload) any images before the main parser has start to load and interpret CSS and JS. example: couldn't load the <img> element, THEN detect the viewport width with JS, then dynamically change the source of image. By then, original image would have already been loaded, and you would load the small image as well-even worse in responsive image terms

Using Modern Image Formats Boldly

new image formats like WebP and AVIF can maintain low file size and high quality at the same time. 

<picture> lets us continue catering to older browsers. can supply MIME types inside type attr so browser can immediately reject unsupported file types:

<picture>
  <source type="image/svg+xml" srcset="pyramid.svg" />
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="pyramid.webp" />
  <img
    src="pyramid.png"
    alt="regular pyramid built from four equilateral triangles" /
</picture>

-Do NOT use media attr, unless you also need art direction.
-in a <source> element, you can only refer to images of the type declared in type.
-use comma-separated lists with srcset and sizes, as needed.

HTML Tables

from MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables

HTML Table Basics
<!--

What is a Table?

a table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data).

A table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data, e.g. a person and their age, or a day of the week, or the timetable for a local swimming pool. 

How Does a Table Work?

The point of a table is that it is rigid. 
information is easily interpreted by making visual associations between row and column headers. 

when implemented correctly, HTML tables are handled well by accessibility tools like screen readers

Table Styling

for tables to be effective on the web, you need to provide some styling info with CSS, as well as good solid structure with HTML.

When Should You NOT Use HTML Tables?

HTML tables should be used for tabular data

NOT for laying out web pages

used to be a more common practice, CSS support across browsers was NOT good. 

Active Learning: Creating Your First Table

content of every table is enclosed in 
<table>
</table>

smallest container inside a table is a table cell, created using <td></td> ('td' stands for 'table data'). 

<table>
  <td>Hi, I'm your first cell.</td>
  <td>I'm your second cell.</td>
  <td>I'm your third cell.</td>
  <td>I'm your fourth cell.</td>
</table>

  table cells line up horizontally with each other and each subsequent cell makes the row longer.

  to place cells into another row we need to use the <tr></tr> element ('tr' stands for 'table row').

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Hi, I'm your first cell.</td>
    <td>I'm your second cell.</td>
    <td>I'm your third cell.</td>
    <td>I'm your fourth cell.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Second row, first cell.</td>
    <td>Cell 2.</td>
    <td>Cell 3.</td>
    <td>Cell 4.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Adding Headers with <th> Elements

table headers-special cells that go at the start of a row or column and define the type of data that row or column contains 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Knocky</td>
    <td>Flor</td>
    <td>Ella</td>
    <td>Juan</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Breed</td>
    <td>Jack Russell</td>
    <td>Poodle</td>
    <td>Streetdog</td>
    <td>Cocker Spaniel</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Age</td>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Owner</td>
    <td>Mother-in-law</td>
    <td>Me</td>
    <td>Me</td>
    <td>Sister-in-law</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eating Habits</td>
    <td>Eats everyone's leftovers</td>
    <td>Nibbles at food</td>
    <td>Hearty eater</td>
    <td>Will eat till he explodes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

problem here is that they are not exactly easy to read. 

if the column and row headings stood out in some way, it would be much better. 

Active Learning: Table Headers

<th></th> denotes a table header. Works the same way as a <td></td> except that it denotes a header, not a normal cell. 

Why are Headers Useful?

easier to find the data you are looking for when the headers clearly stand out (and the design just looks better). 

Also have an added benefit-along with the scope attribute, they allow you to make tables more accessible by associating each header with all the data in the same row or column. 

Allowing Cells to Span Multiple Rows and Columns

table headers and cells have the 
colspan
rowspan
attributes, which allow us to do just those things. 

Both accept a unitless number value, which equals the number of rows or columns you want spanned. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Animals</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Hippopotamus</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Horse</th>
    <td>Mare</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stallion</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Crocodile</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Chicken</th>
    <td>Hen</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rooster</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Providing Common Styling to Columns

Styling without <col>

HTML has a method of defining styling info for an entire column of data all in one place-the
<col></col>
<colgroup></colgroup>
elements

help to specify styling on columns
otherwise you'd have to specify every <td></td> and <th></th> in column, or use a complex selector such as 
:nth-child.

NOTE: styling columns like this is limited to a few properties:
border
background
width
visibility
to set other properties you'll have to either style every <td></td> or <th></th> in the column or use a complex selector such as :nth-child

ex: 
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Data 1</th>
    <th style="background-color: yellow">Data 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Calcutta</td>
    <td style="background-color: yellow">Orange</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Robots</td>
    <td style="background-color: yellow">Jazz</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Not ideal as we have to repeat the style info across all three cells in the column (we'd probably have a class set on all three in a real project and specify the styling in a separate stylesheet).

Styling with <col>

Instead of doing above, we can specify the info once, on a <col>
element. 
<col> elements are specified inside a 
<colgroup> container just below the opening <table> tag.

<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col />
    <col style="background-color: yellow" />
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>Data 1</th>
    <th>Data 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Calcutta</td>
    <td>Orange</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Robots</td>
    <td>Jazz</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Effectively we are defining two "style columns", one specifying styling info for each column. 

we are not styling the first column, but we still have to include a blank <col> element-if we didn't, the styling would just be applied to the first column. 

if we wanted to apply the style info to both columns, we could just include one <col> element with a span attribute on it

<colgroup>
  <col style="background-color: yellow; span="2" />
</colgroup>

just like colspan and rowspan, span takes a unitless number value that specifies the number of columns you want the styling to apply to.

HTML Table Advanced Features and accessibility

<!--

Adding a Caption to your Table with <caption>

can give a table a caption by putting it inside a 
<caption> element and nesting inside the <table> element. It should be just below the opening <table> tag

<table>
  <caption>
    Dinosaurs are Awesome
  </caption>
  ...
</table>

meant to contain a description of table contents. 
useful for all readers

particularly useful for blind users-screen reader will read caption first and then they can decide if they want to hear info in the cells. 

NOTE: the summary attr can also be used on the <table> element to provide a description. 
  while this is read out by screen readers, it is deprecated (it doesn't appear on the page).

Adding Structure with <thead>, <tfoot>, and <tbody>

tables with more complex structure should have more structural definition. 

<thead>, <tfoot>, and <tbody> all you to mark up a header, footer, and body section for the table. 

these elements don't elp with screen readers, and don't result in any visual changes.
however,
they are very useful for styling and layout-acting as useful hooks for adding CSS to the table. 

To use them: 

<thead> element must wrap the header-usually the first row containing column headings, but not always.
  if using <col>/<colgroup> element(s), <thead> should come just below those.

<tfoot> element needs to wrap the footer-might be the final row with items in previous rows summed, for example. 
you can include the table footer right at the bottom of the table as you'd expect, or just below table header (browser will still render at bottom of table).

<tbody> element needs to wrap the other parts of the table content that aren't in table header or table footer. 
will appear below the table header or sometimes footer, depending on how you decide to structure. 

NOTE: <tbody> is always included in every table, implicitly, even if you don't specify it in your code. Browser will add a tag for it (can see in dev tools). Worth including because it gives you more control over your table structure and styling. 

Nesting Tables

if necessary, you can nest a table inside another table. Just be sure to use the <table> element. 

ex:

<table id="table1">
  <tr>
    <th>title1</th>
    <th>title2</th>
    <th>title3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="nested">
      <table id="table2">
        <tr>
          <td>cell1</td>
          <td>cell2</td>
          <td>cell3</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </td>
    <td>cell2</td>
    <td>cell3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cell4</td>
    <td>cell5</td>
    <td>cell6</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Tables for Visually Impaired Users

Not difficult for screen readers with plain text, but tables can be tough. 

Using Column and Row Headers

screen readers will id all headers and use them to make programmatic associations between those headers and the cells they relate to. 
the combo of column and row headers will id and interpret the data in each cell so screen reader users can interpret the table similarly to how a sighted user does.

The Scope Attribute

scope attribute can be added to the <th> element to tell screen readers exactly what cells the header is a header for-is it a header for the row it is in, or the column, for example?

for example, could unambiguously define the column headers as column headers like this:

<thead>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Purchase</th>
    <th scope="col">Location</th>
    <th scope="col">Date</th>
    <th scope="col">Evaluation</th>
    <th scope="col">Cost (€)</th>
  </tr>
</thead>

and each row could have a header defined like this 

<tr>
  <th scope="row">Haircut</th>
  <td>Hairdresser</td>
  <td>12/09</td>
  <td>Great idea</td>
  <td>30</td>
</tr>

screen readers will recognize markup structured like this, and allow their users to read out the entire column or row at once, for example. 

scope has two more possible values-

colgroup and
rowgroup

scope="colgroup"
as opposed to 
scope="col"

these are used for headings that sit over the top of multiple columns or rows. 

The id and headers Attributes

alternative to using the scope attribute is to use id and headers attributes to create associations b/w headers and cells. used as follows:

1. add a unique id to each <th> element
2. add headers attribute to each <td> element. each headers attribute has to contain a list of the ids of all the <th> elements that act as a header for that cell, separated by spaces. 

gives your HTML table an explicit definition of the position of each cell in the table, defined by the header(s) for each column and row it is a part of, kind of like a spreadsheet. For it to work well, the table really needs both column and row headers. 

could be written like this:

<thead>
  <tr>
    <th id="purchase">Purchase</th>
    <th id="location">Location</th>
    <th id="date">Date</th>
    <th id="evaluation">Evaluation</th>
    <th id="cost">Cost ($)</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <th id="haircut">Haircut</th>
    <td headers="location haircut">Hairdresser</td>
    <td headers="date haircut">12/09</td>
    <td headers="evaluation haircut">Great idea</td>
    <td headers="cost haircut">30</td>
  </tr>
  ...
</tbody>

NOTE: this method creates very precise associations between headers and data cells but it uses A LOT more markup and does not leave any room for errors. The scope approach is usually enough for most tables.

HTML Validator

HTML code should be run through an HTML Checker

have used this one so far:

https://validator.w3.org/nu/
